# Matplotlib-barchart
Onepiece characters popularity
I saw the barchart video on YouTube and it's quite interesting. So I think maybe I can try in Python.
So far, I don't have the actual data yet. I just make up some data to draw the bar chart. Animation is cool that make it moves. 
Targets:
1. more characters Y
2. real data Y
3. date data Y
4. add the character's icon by the side Y
5. add scene pic by the side
6. Excel data is not showing here, maybe I can use MySQL to show it
