# Matplotlib-barchart
Onepiece characters popularity
I saw the barchart video on Red and it's quite interesting. So I think maybe I can try in Python.
So far, I don't have the actual data yet. I just make up some data to draw the bar chart. Animation is cool that make it moves. 
Targets:
1. more characters
2. real data
3. more years, like up to 2022
4. add the character's icon by the side
5. add scene pic by years
