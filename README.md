One Piece Characters Popularity
I saw the barchart video on YouTube which is quite interesting. So I think I can try in Python.
Animation is so cool that make it moves. 
Steps:
1. more characters Y
2. real data Y
3. date data Y
4. add the character's icon by the side Y
5. add scene pic by the side Y
It's quite rough, not smooth as the YouTube, but it's cool to do it.
